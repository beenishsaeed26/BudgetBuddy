# BudgetBuddy
As a university student, I noticed that keeping track of expenses can be tedious and overwhelming for many students. To make this easier, I created BudgetBuddy: a simple command-line tool to help you manage your personal finances effortlessly!

Features:
- Set a monthly budget.
- Add transactions.
- Check your current balance and see if youâ€™ve exceeded your budget.
- Generate a summary of your finances and save it locally.
